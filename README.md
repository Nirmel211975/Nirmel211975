- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nirmel211975
- 👀 I’m interested in music, electroacoustics and electronics, informatic as programming languages, arts, martial arts (YMAA) and meditation, studying more and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning server programmation, and keeping on studying by myself notabily electroacoustic mathematics, solving equations one by one.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I do want to work without help, as in my musical compositions and recordings and my books, in auto-production and auto-edition, as I don't need to use other peoples working capabilities.
- 📫 How to reach me is at http://merlinproductions-randd.eu and the legal sites where you can read or listen to some parts of my working results.
